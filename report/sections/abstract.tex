\section{Abstract}

Extensive research and clear guidelines have emerged for the imputation
of variable sets that exhibit interdependence where that interdependence can be effectively modeled to fill in the dataset.
Multiple imputation and its derivative methods serve as the state of the art for
data sets with conforming characteristics. Little guidance can be found
for orthogonal feature sets. The originally proposed study called for a factorial experiment
to measure the shape of model degradation as measured in the presence of various levels of missing data, data relationship characteristics, and imputation methods.
Serious challenges arose when constructing experimental factor combinations free of secondary effects.
These challenges proved insurmountable given the constraints of the research.
As a result, this paper will conclude with an exploration of model degradation in a set of cases that cannot be directly compared mathematically.
No specific recommendations can be made with confidence.
