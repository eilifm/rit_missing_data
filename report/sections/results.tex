\section{Results and Analysis}

Inversion imputation forces the missing data onto the line defined by the remaining data. The imputed data set is now biased
toward the model with which it was imputed. When a model is fit again to the whole data set, the result is a
tighter CI around the $\beta_{1}$ estimate. This bias is magnified as the percentage of missing data increases. The model will
also converge on zero error as the vast majority of data points will be exactly on the inverted model line. Whether or
not this is the correct line, the model will converge on perfect fit as seen in the $R^2$ plots.
