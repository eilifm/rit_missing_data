\section{Introduction}

Handling missing data effectively
Datasets often have missing data in some or all of the features of interest.
Given a data set with independent regressors that can be described using ordinary
least squares linear regression, what is the best way to fill in any missing data.


There is extensive literature on how to leverage feature relationships
to fill in missing data however there is little information on the best practices
for data imputation of independent data sets.
The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of various data
imputation methods on the model performance and provide recommendations on best
practices for independent datasets.
